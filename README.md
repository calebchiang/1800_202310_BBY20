## 4. Complete setup/installion/usage
State what a user needs to do when they come to your project.  How do others start using your code or application?
Here are the steps ...
* 1. This project contains a user authentication service from firebase which requires an api activation which is not included. For this to work properly you must add your own.
* 2. This project also uses google maps api. While there is a key at the bottom of the map.html, it is restricted to certain websites. For it to function properly you will have to add a personal key.
* 3. Once those are in place, you can run this project using a live serving program, like visual studio code or similar

* 2. Currently the posts page sorts by recency. We wanted to sort it by a range around a users' location or specified 'home' address so that the posts are more relevent to them.
* ...
